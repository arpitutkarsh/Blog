# Blog Project
Welcome to my **Blog Website** a platform where users can CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE blog posts. This project is built with a modern Tech Stack using **ReactJS**, **Appwrite**, **JavaScript**, **TailwindCSS**
to deliver a fast, clean and responsive User Experience.

## Features
- 🔐 User Authentication (Sign Up / Login / Logout)
- 📝 Create, Edit, and Delete Posts
- 📃 View All Blog Posts
- 🖼️ Upload and Manage Images via Appwrite Storage
- 📱 Fully Responsive UI
- ⚡ Fast, Minimal, and Clean Design using TailwindCSS

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Frontend     | Backend/Database |
|--------------|------------------|
| ReactJS      | Appwrite         |
| HTML         | Appwrite Storage |
| CSS          | Appwrite Auth    |
| TailwindCSS  |                  |
| JavaScript   |                  |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Authentication** is handled by Appwrite's Auth service.
2. **Database** operations (CRUD for posts) are done using Appwrite Database SDK.
3. **Image Upload** is managed via Appwrite’s storage service and linked to each post.
4. The **frontend** is built in ReactJS with TailwindCSS for rapid UI development.
